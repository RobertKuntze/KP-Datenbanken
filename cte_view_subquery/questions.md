### CTE, (Mat.) View, Sub-Query, Temp. Table
Is the Postgres-Optimizer able to find the optimal plan for Subqueries, Common Table Expressions, Views, Materialized Views and Temopary Tables for a query with the same expected output?

### Complex Recursive CTE with Cycle Detection
Is the Postgres-Optimizer able to find a fitting plan for recursive common table expressions with cycle detection within a certain acceptable margin of error?
How does the positioning of the `DISTINCT` keyword affect the speed of recursive CTEs with cycle detection.
